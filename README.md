Repository for Python library dedicated to fight the cyberbullying

Cyberbullying, in the age of digitalization and global connectivity, represents an increasingly growing and concerning phenomenon. Unlike traditional bullying, which manifests through physical or verbal interactions, cyberbullying has the capability to reach victims anytime and anywhere. This feature significantly amplifies the potential negative repercussions on the victims, who might feel continuously threatened, even when they are in an environment perceived as safe.

This thesis mainly focuses on the study of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the aim of developing a library dedicated to the detection and prevention of cyberbullying. The interest in NLP stems from its unique ability to analyze and interpret human language, thereby offering the opportunity to identify linguistic patterns that could indicate online bullying incidents.

The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language, renowned for being particularly suitable for handling and processing large volumes of data. Throughout my research, I examined several NLP libraries, highlighting their primary features, from tokenization to sentiment detection. This inquiry provided me with the necessary foundation to develop a tailored library, specifically designed for the needs of this study.

The results indicate that, although there isn't a single definitive solution, the combination of technology and understanding of human language is an effective response to the issue of cyberbullying. By implementing such solutions on digital and social platforms, one can not only detect inappropriate behaviors in real-time but also educate users about the significance and potential repercussions of their words.
